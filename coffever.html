On the one hand, it helps the user control the amount of water and weight of coffee grounds - the two variables that have the most significant impact on the taste and quality of the coffee. On the other hand, it helps the user during the process of pouring water over the coffee grounds in displaying the optimal water flow speed as determined by a water flow sensor.

					</div>
					<p class="description pb-3">
						According to the National Coffee Association (NCA) report on  American coffee consumption in 2017, the number of daily coffee drinkers has increased. Of all the coffee consumed daily, <b class="bolder">59% was specialty</b>. What it means is that more people are drinking coffee not just to get them through their day, but at a deeper understanding of its unique flavors, specific origins, brewing methods, etc. 
					</p>
					<p class="description pb-3">
						To understand these "gourmets" and coffee itself better, we conducted <b class="bolder">preliminary research</b>, including semi-structured interviews with coffee enthusiasts and secondary analysis from online sources. . 
						<!-- which means for the rest of the process there is no access to <b class="bolder">add and modify new requests, keep track of the records and check work progress.</b> -->
					</p>
					<p class="description pb-3">
						What we knew from our pilot study was that many coffee lovers ended up brewing coffee themselves due to their higher pursuing of quality, taste and deeper understanding of the coffee. We learned that the <b class="bolder">pour-over method</b> is very popular because it allows for maximum manual tweaks in the process. We also discovered their <b class="bolder">passion for coffee, frustrations during the brewing process and routine to experiment and improve. </b>

						We started our formative study with <b class="bolder">recruiting participants</b> by sending out emails, asking for “coffee lovers” that brew their coffee at home using “non-automatic” methods. We received 55 responses; the most popular brewing method was pour-over (42%), followed by French press (38%). In choosing participants, we looked for persons who indicated that they brew coffee more than 5 times a week and use brewing gears that require more manual brewing activities so that we can capture more data.

							<h3>Diary Study and In-depth Interviews</h3>
							<p class="description pb-3">
								To learn more about how the act of brewing coffee fits in with their daily lives, the physical setup, the environment and their feelings during the brewing process, we conducted <b class="bolder">3 diary studies</b> and <b class="bolder">2 in-depth interviews</b> with home brewers. 
							</p>
							<p class="description pb-3">
								We asked the 3 agreed participants to take photos and make annotations of their thoughts and feelings whenever they engaged in any coffee related-activities, whether it be buying, brewing, or consuming, for at least <b class="bolder">4 days</b>. We choose <b class="bolder">Photo-elicitation study method</b> as it's less disruptive to concentration-heavy brewing process than other methods. At the end of the period, we conduct a <b class="bolder">post-interview</b> with each of them based on developed protocol.

				<p class="description pb-3">
					<b class="bolder">Smart Grinder.</b> We also included a grinder with integrated scales to measure the weight of the grounds, as well as a pulsating grind size adjustment ring (from concept 2) to set the coarseness of the grounds. It automatically grinds beans until the grounds have reached the desired coarseness level. a Gooseneck kettle spout-attachment with sensors that measure water flow (speed), the total amount of water, and water temperature.

					Our final brewing system - Coffever, comprises an App assistant and a smart product set that talks to each other which includes a smart grinder and kettle. 
				</p>
				<p class="description pb-3">
					<b class="bolder">Smart Kettle:</b> Smart Kettle is an electric kettle heats up a certain amount of water to a predefined temperature. It also guides the user to pour over by telling the user the time for each pour, the suggested tilt angle through a graph on an LCD. 
				</p>
				<p class="description pb-3">
					<b class="bolder">Smart Grinder:</b> Smart Grinder recognizes the type of coffee beans by scanning the QR code on the coffee pouch. Additionally, it measures the weight of the coffee grounds and grinds only the correct amount of beans. It also suggests the coarseness of the grounds on the ring according to the type of beans used.

				</p>
				<p class="description pb-3">
					<b class="bolder">Smartphone APP:</b> The Smartphone App tells the user suggested properties of different variables through the other two devices. It first recognizes the type of beans via the QR code or manually entering by the user. All the data syncs with it during the brewing process which will be used to generate a daily summary for reflection.

					<b class="bolder">Step 1:</b> The user enters the coffee profile by scanning the QR code on the coffee pouch via grinder and sets the wake-up time of the system via the smartphone app.  
				</p>
				<p class="description pb-3">
					<b class="bolder">Step 2:</b> In the next morning, he wakes up and walks into the kitchen. The system detects his presence, so the smart kettle begins to blink and chime, reminding him to boil water which he sometimes forgets.   
				</p>
				<p class="description pb-3">
					<b class="bolder">Step 3:</b> Since there are still coffee beans left, the grinder automatically works when the smart kettle starts to boil water.    
				</p>
				<p class="description pb-3">
					<b class="bolder">Step 4:</b> The user then sets up the coarseness level suggested by the grinder and pushes the button to start the grinding.     
				</p>
				<p class="description pb-3">
					After this, he leaves the kitchen and gets ready for work. Both the water and the ground are ready when he comes back.      
				</p>
				<p class="description pb-3">
					<b class="bolder">Step 5:</b> He puts the coffee grounds into the dripper (with filter) and starts pouring over following the guidance of the smart kettle. He adjusts the tilt angle of the kettle by following the ascending triangle on the LCD to keep the right pouring over speed. He stops when the white bar entirely turns to blue, suggesting this pour is complete.      
				</p>
				<p class="description pb-3">
					<b class="bolder">Step 6:</b> Now, the user can enjoy a good cup of coffee. Meanwhile, he can check all the summary data of this brewing experience and knows what to improve for next time.

						We found that the act of pouring over is the essential step of the brewing process, so we decided to focus our prototype on the <b class="bolder">smart kettle</b>. However, our prototype does not measure the amount of water but the tilt angle of the kettle instead. For the next step, we propose to use a flow sensor at the tip of the kettle spout which allows for accurate measurement of the amount of water. 
					</p>
					<p class="description pb-3">
						Due to the time constraints, we didn’t build a prototype of the <b class="bolder">smart grinder</b>. We have to consider whether to make a grinder that weighs the grounds or if we should focus on the adjustment ring.
					</p>
					<p class="description pb-3">
						To validate the system, we need to conduct various <b class="bolder">usability tests</b> to find out how the prototype resonates with users. It's also necessary to create a clickable prototype of the <b class="bolder">smartphone app</b> to evaluate its usefulness.
